<p><b>Task:</b> We test here how well various open machine translation (MT) models, large language models (LLM), and commercial MT services handle tagged text and text that features rare (or even unseen) Unicode characters.<br /></p>
<p class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Why is this important?</b> In order to apply a model/service in production, it must be reliable and able to handle unexpected data that users throw at the system (or at least not break when encountering such content).</p>
<p>
Some use cases, such as, web site translation, document translation, MT in computer-assisted translation tools require that MT systems are able to handle formatting tags. There are two ways how formatting tag support can be ensured:
<ol>
<li>the MT system handles tags outside the MT model (this is typical for commercial MT services), or</li>
<li>the MT system lets the MT model handle tags by generating tags and the translation together.</li>
</ol>
Some people believe LLMs can do this reliably; we will benchmark this belief here! If models are not able to generate in output the same number and type of tags that they receive in input, translation workflows that depend on valid tag placement may (and most likely will) fail if the sequence of tags is invalid (e.g., it is overlapping, closing tags are before opening tags, closing tags are missing, whole tag pairs are missing, excess tags are present, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Some newer LLMs may not have issues with handling rare Unicode characters as they are trained with byte backoff, which means that any character that is not included in the vocabulary is split into individual bytes. Since there are only 256 valid byte values, the models may be able to handle unseen Unicode characters naturally. We shall see this in this benchmark!</p>
<p><b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores/blob/main/flores200/README.md" target="_blank">FLORES-200 dataset</a> - devtest subset for English and Latvian. We use the first 200 sentence pairs and introduce Unicode characters and tags on the source and target sides as follows:
<ul>
<li>We add a random Unicode character that represents some icon (emoticons, transport and map symbols, chess symbols, etc. characters that are seldom found in documents; from 0x1F330 till 0x1FAC6) in a random position in each sentence. We repeat the dataset 10 times, each time increasing the number of randomly placed emoticons by 1 (up to 10). The whole dataset becomes 2000 sentence pairs long.</li>
<li>We add a random &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tag around a randomly selected token. Similarly to the Unicode characters, we increase the number of &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags by one every 200 sentences (up to 10 in total). Since we add tags randomly and iteratively, it is possible that the same token is tagged multiple times and if the Unicode characters are added after a token that gets tagged, the Unicode characters are also included within the tag (this makes the dataset more complex, but also more natural).</li>
<li>Throughout the dataset, we selected a random span of 2 to 5 tokens and added an &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; tag around them. Similarly to above, it can be that the tags are put around existing tags and introduced unicode characters effectively increasing the number of tokens covered by the tags.</li>
<li>Throughout the dataset (the whole 2000 sentences), we add &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; tags around every other sentence.</li>
</ul>
In order to add tags around the same source and target tokens and Unicode characters after the same source and target tokens, we perform word alignment using <a href="https://github.com/cisnlp/simalign" target="_blank">simalign</a>. We use only one-to-one alignment pairs to make sure that the alignment is parallel and we add the same number of tags and Unicode characters for each sentence pair on both (source and target) sides.
The following is an example of a sentence pair from the FLORES-200 dataset enriched with rare characters and tags.

<p class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert"><i>Note 1:</i> This is the typical message structure passed to the Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, etc. LLM inferencing clients and passed to the apply_chat_template() method for models stored in Hugging Face and inferenced directly on python using the transformers library, however, the messages are formatted for each LLM differently depending on what the exact chat template for each model defines. For instance Google's Gemma models do not have system prompts, and ollama adds the system message just as a second user message (for Gemma 3) or as the beginning of the user message (for Gemma 2). For Teuken models, the apply_chat_template did not support system prompts at all. For those, we appended the system message at the beginning of the user message.<br />
<i>Note 2:</i> NMT models are inferenced without such messages! For NMT models, we execute API functions for translation by specifying a source language, target language and the text to be translated. For <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/m2m_100" target="_blank">M2M100</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/nllb" target="_blank">NLLB</a> models, we use the exact scripts specified in the Hugging Face documentation of each model (follow the links to see the commands for translation).<br />
<!--<i>Note 3:</i> The Google T5 models were inferenced using the example provided in the Hugging Face documentation (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5" target="_blank">here</a>), but since they show very poor performance, we have a feeling that something must be wrong in the documentation (the model's can't surely be that bad, right?). Let us know if you find we should have inferenced them differently.-->
</p>
<p><b>Metrics</b>: We calculate the Jaccard index (true positives divided by the sum of true positives, false positives and false negatives) for the introduced Unicode characters and tags. We analyse them separately. We also look at the proportion of sentences that have valid tag sequences in the translations.</p>
<p><b>Commercial MT systems:</b> Google Translate, DeepL, and Tilde MT systems have been added for comparison. Note that we do not know much about the architecture, size of Google's and DeepL's systems, nor we know whether they use one model for all directions or separate models for each direction. The parameter size estimates are just guesses for Google and DeepL, and may be miles off. For Tilde MT, we include our general domain unidirectional systems that feature Transformer Base and Big architectures. If we compare to LLMs, these are rather small models (Transformer Big has ~200 million parameters only; compare that to 9 billion for EuroLLM).</p>

<h2>List of Benchmarked Models and Systems</h2>
<p class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<i>Note 1:</i> There are two types of systems/models compared - encoder-decoder machine translation models (models that were specifically trained only for the task of machine translation) and decoder-only LLMs (instruction-tuned LLMs that are able to perform many tasks, not just machine translation).
<!--, and we included also Google's T5 models that are encoder-decoder language models (LM), which are able to perform several concrete NLP tasks.--><br />
<i>Note 2:</i> Most Ollama models are 4 bit quantized models, whereas the Hugging Face models are not quantized. We have no information (to be fair, no one has) what quantization level (if any) the commercial API models have. We have analyzed the impact of quantization on MT quality (see <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.nodalida-1.30.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>) and found that it is mostly negligible for larger models (e.g., for the Gemma&nbsp;2 27B model, the quality drop was 0.001 COMET point). However, we want to be transparent about this and it is why we include URLs to the exact models we benchmarked.
